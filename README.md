🌳 Student Management System (BST Implementation)
This project is a practical implementation of Binary Search Trees (BST) in Java to manage university classes and students.

The main challenge of this project was to implement the data structures from scratch, manipulating memory references manually without relying on Java's built-in libraries (like ArrayList, TreeMap, or HashMap).

🚀 Features
Nested Tree Structure:

Outer Tree: Manages Classes (ordered by ID).

Inner Tree: Manages Students within each class (ordered alphabetically).

Manual Memory Management: Direct manipulation of node references (left/right pointers).

Data Normalization: Automatic handling of string input (lowercase and accent removal).

Traversals: Implementation of In-Order, Pre-Order, and Reverse Order traversals.

Statistics: Algorithms to find the largest and smallest classes.

Global Listing: A custom algorithm to flatten the tree and display all students from all classes in a single alphabetical list.

🛠️ Technologies
Language: Java

Concepts: Data Structures, Recursion, Algorithms.
